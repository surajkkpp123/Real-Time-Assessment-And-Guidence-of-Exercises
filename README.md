# Real-Time-Assessment-And-Guidence-of-Exercises
Our application, GymMate is a perfect workout friend and a guide for
those who choose to live a healthy lifestyle. It provides to itâ€™s users a set
of exercises to choose from, evaluate their workout routine, check their
heart rate and to remain fit.
We have come up with a solution that is both easy to use and can be af-
forded by everyone. All one requires is a laptop or a personal computer
with a webcam.

Our project, Real Time Assessment and Guidance of Exercises, as the name suggests, aims at providing to the user, all the facilities provided by a gym (including the fitness trainer!) by assessing the exercise being performed by the user and guiding him whether his postures are right or wrong. We aim at providing to the user, the convenience to perform his exercises at home. All he needs to do is to provide us with some medical history and choose the exercise that he wants to perform among a number of exercises that are allowed for him based on his medical conditions. Be- sides, we also aim to keep track of his pulse rate so that he may not over- perform the exercises
